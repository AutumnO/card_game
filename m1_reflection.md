CS 211 - Spring 2020 - M1 Card Game Reflection
Autumn Ossello

M1 was extremely straight forward, the tutorial was much easier to follow that roll a ball, especially since he was running the same version of unity, although dark mode for Visual Studios was a bit difficult to see with the lower resolution required by the HSU Library internet. I appreciated how he explained what all the code and unity functions were doing in depth, I felt like I gained more knowledge from this tutorial than the two lab tutorials. I also appreciated how he left errors or glitches in so there wasn’t too much information all at once and the purpose of each setting or action was clear from the incorrect behavior. 
For future students, I recommend using two monitors, one with your project and one with the tutorial open, so it’s easy to pause the video when needed and easier match settings without frequently changing tabs. 
I did run into an unresolved issue with the canvas size, which I tried and failed to correct. The size of my cards are half of those in the tutorial because my canvas size was more flat than his and didn’t allow for the same size cards. They still stick out a bit from the sides of the player and enemy areas although I like how this looks and it doesn’t interfere with the drop zone. I wasn’t sure how to approach this in pieces since it only took about two hours total and I didn’t run into any issues so I only have one push to GitHub. If I were to expand on the tutorial outside of the milestone’s requirements I would have additional pushes but as is they seemed unnecessarily disruptive to the flow of work. 
I am curious about the actual process unity was using before the cards were set to not collide, it seemed random but some very odd things were occurring that piqued my interest.
